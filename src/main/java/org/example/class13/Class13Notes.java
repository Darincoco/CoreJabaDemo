/*
1. Docker:
    Docker vs VM
        1. dock is easy to start up, vm need to assign storage
        2. docker has minimum overhead, vm has specific guest OS which will cause overhead
        3. docker is easy to do horizontal scale
    Dockerfile -> docker image -> docker container
    Docker operation: cmd line, docker desktop
    Docker architecture:
        Docker engine
        Docker client
        Docker registry(private or standard on docker hub)
    Docker deployments and orchestration:
        docker plugins
        docker compose
        docker swarm
        k8s


2. AWS
    Elastic Load Balancing vs API gateway(both used to route requests to different server):
    ELB: route request to different server
    API gateway: route requests to different service(delivery, transaction, order...)

    AWS region: a physical location around the world where data centers in
    Edge locations: CDN(Content Delivery Network)
