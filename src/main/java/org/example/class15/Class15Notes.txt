1. Security
    Authentication vs Authorization
        Authentication: validate the user
        Authorization: check permission

    Encryption, Hashing, Encoding
        Encryption: have decryption, use key to encrypt/ decrypt,
                    Symmetric: encryption decryption keys the same
                    Asymmetric: encryption decryption key different, private key(keep), public key(share)
                                http -> https(secured version)
                    algorithm: AES, 3-DES, SNOW / RSA
        Hashing: one way, no decryption, lose the data
                client send data to server, send hashed data to server; after server receives the data, hash it as well,
                compare the hash data with origin hash data to check if it is modified
                algorithm: MD5, SHA...
                usage: data integration / password storage / file management
                rainbow table
        Encoding:
                algorithm: base64...
                use case: url encoding

    JWT: header / payload / verify signature
    Oauth2.0: third party validation
