/*
1. Web Architecture
    Web application and web service
        web app: Amazon.com, GUI
        web service: one component of web app


2. Evolution of web architecture
    Monolithic: backend frontend all in server. Not convenient for modifying
    Front-back separation: separate back end and front end,  client side to front end, front end to backend or vice versa
    Way to communicate:
        front end send request to back end for data
        web-socket: connection between back end front end, back end doesn't need to wait for request,
        push data directly to front end through web-socket
    Service oriented architecture:
        ESB: enterprise service bus
    Microservice:
        each service has its own database
    Mirco-Front:
        webpack


3. Communication
    REST: json, xml, html
    SOAP: xml
    RPC: remote procedure call
    GraphQL: pull data from multiple data resource with single call


4. data store
    sql: Mysql, Oracle, Sql server...
    no-sql: mongoDB, Cassandra
    cache: redis, mem-cache


5. Operating System
    Linux,
    Windows, Mac


6. SOLID Principle
    Single Responsibility Principle
    Open-closed Principle
    Liskov Substitution Principle
    Interface Segregation Principle
    Dependency Inversion Principle
